# Introduction to a Rubik's Cube

A standard 3×3 Rubik’s Cube has 6 faces, each with 9 facelets (3 rows × 3 columns).

A **cubie** is the actual physical piece (corner, edge, or center) that makes up the cube.

A **facelet** is just the colored part of a cubie that’s visible on the surface.

That totals 54 facelets across the entire cube.
Each facelet is a sticker or tile that shows the cube’s color at that position.

- Center cubies have 1 facelet.
- Edge cubies have 2 facelets.
- Corner cubies have 3 facelets.
